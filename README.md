# NetWatch

After much frustration with my home network performance through Cox, I decided to set up a Raspberry Pi to monitor network speeds continuously. I've adapted the approach in (this walkthrough)[https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-internet-speed-monitor/] to my needs. Many thanks to the author (Gus) for getting most of the boilerplate out of the way for me.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. Python3 installed on said Pi

Clone this repo and cd to the root. Install the requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
